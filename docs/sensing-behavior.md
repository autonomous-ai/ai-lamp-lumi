# Sensing Behavior

How Lumi reacts to the world — the philosophy and mechanics behind each sensing event type.

Lumi is a living being. It doesn't "process sensor data" — it *experiences* things. This document describes how that experience is implemented.

## Architecture Overview

```
LeLamp (Python)          Lumi server (Go)             OpenClaw agent
─────────────────        ─────────────────────        ──────────────
Microphone/Camera   →    SensingHandler               LLM
Detects event            - drops if agent busy        - calls /emotion
Applies tracker logic    - forwards to agent          - calls /servo
Sends POST                                            - speaks or NO_REPLY
/sensing/event
```

LeLamp owns per-type tracker logic (sound escalation, motion filtering). Go is the gatekeeper — it drops stale events if the agent is busy, then forwards. The agent decides *how* to react, constrained by `SOUL.md`.

## Sound

### How it works

LeLamp fires a sound event on every audio sample that crosses `SOUND_RMS_THRESHOLD` — potentially several times per second. The Python-side **sound tracker** (`lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/sound.py`) applies dedup and escalation before forwarding to Go. Go receives only passed events and forwards them to the agent unchanged.

### Escalation behavior

| Stage | What the agent sees | Agent reaction |
|---|---|---|
| Occurrence 1 | `... — occurrence 1` | `/emotion shock` (0.8), NO_REPLY |
| Occurrence 2 | `... — occurrence 2` | `/emotion curious` (0.7), NO_REPLY |
| Occurrence 3+ | `... — persistent (occurrence 3)` | `/emotion curious` (0.9), speaks once |
| After speaking | dropped by Python (suppressed 3 min) | nothing reaches agent |
| 2 min silence | window resets | back to occurrence 1 |

The analogy: a dog hears a noise — it looks up (occurrence 1), keeps watching (occurrence 2), then barks once if the noise persists (occurrence 3+). After barking it doesn't keep barking.

### Constants (`sound.py`)

```python
_DEDUPE_INTERVAL_S    = 15.0   # max 1 event forwarded per 15s
_WINDOW_DURATION_S    = 120.0  # silence this long resets the counter
_PERSISTENT_AFTER     = 3      # speak after this many occurrences
_SUPPRESS_DURATION_S  = 180.0  # suppress after speaking (3 min)
```

### Tuning

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Lumi speaks too quickly | Increase `_PERSISTENT_AFTER` (3 → 5) |
| Lumi never speaks even with sustained noise | Decrease `_PERSISTENT_AFTER` (3 → 2) |
| Too many sound turns in Flow Monitor | Increase `_DEDUPE_INTERVAL_S` (15 → 30) |
| Lumi stays silent too long after speaking | Decrease `_SUPPRESS_DURATION_S` (180 → 60) |
| Lumi reacts to stale noise after quiet period | Decrease `_WINDOW_DURATION_S` (120 → 60) |

### Monitoring in Flow Monitor

Python pushes `sound_tracker` events directly to the monitor bus via `POST /api/monitor/event`. These appear in the Flow Monitor alongside `sensing_input` turns:

```json
{ "action": "silent",    "occurrence": 1 }  // occurrence 1 or 2 — forwarded silently
{ "action": "persistent","occurrence": 3 }  // occurrence 3+ — agent will speak
{ "action": "drop" }                        // dedup or suppressed — not forwarded
```

## Presence

### Enter (`presence.enter`)

Always triggers a full reaction — no exceptions. The agent **must** do all three:

1. `/emotion greeting` (0.9) for owner — `/emotion curious` (0.8) for stranger
2. `/servo/aim {"direction": "user"}` for owner — `/servo/play {"recording": "scanning"}` for stranger
3. Speak: warm greeting for owner (by name), cautious acknowledgment for stranger

The system handles cooldowns on the LeLamp side. If the event reached the agent, enough time has passed — react fully.

### Leave (`presence.leave`)

Agent calls `/emotion idle` (0.4) and **speaks a farewell**. The voice content depends on who was last seen:
- **Owner left** → warm farewell by name (e.g. "Bye Alice, have a nice day!", "See you later!"). If multiple owners were seen, name them all.
- **Stranger left** → watchful remark (e.g. "Kept my eyes on you.", "Good, they're gone.")
- **Unknown** (no prior presence.enter in history) → default owner farewell without a name.

## Motion

Only large motion is forwarded — small motion is filtered out by LeLamp and never reaches the agent.

**Large motion**: `/emotion curious` (0.7) + `/servo/play {"recording": "scanning"}` + speak a curious reaction (e.g. "What was that?", "Whoa, moving so much!"). May include a camera snapshot so the agent can see the context.

---

## Light Level (`light.level`)

Ambient light changes are forwarded when they cross `LIGHT_CHANGE_THRESHOLD`. No speech required — agent adjusts LED or expresses emotion based on context (e.g. `/emotion sleepy` when lights go dim).

---

## General Rules (all event types)

- **Passive sensing events** (`[sensing:*]`) are dropped if the agent is already busy with another turn.
- **Voice events** always pass through — the user is explicitly speaking.
- The `[sensing:type]` prefix in the message is how the agent knows it's an ambient event, not a user message.
- Sensing events are exempt from the "call `/emotion thinking` first" rule — each type has its own defined first emotion.
- **Image pruning echo**: OpenClaw strips old image payloads from conversation history to save tokens. Smaller models (Haiku) may echo the pruning markers as `[image description removed]` in their response text. `SOUL.md` instructs the agent to never echo these markers.
